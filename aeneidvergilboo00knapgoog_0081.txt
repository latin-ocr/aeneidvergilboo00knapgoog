211 Tmesis.-Compound words are sometimes resolvcd into
their elements, which are then separated by an intervening
vvord or words; 1. 610 qnae ene cnmqne 0000011000·οω v. 603
linc celebrate tenns . . . certamine ,· x. 794 pedem referens
(‘dragging’) et inutilis inqne lipetns cedebat. cf. ‘the love
of God to us ward! .

212 Juxtaposition. —Words which express contrasted ideas (less
often those expressing related ideas) are frequently set side
by side; i. 184 nnllam, tris,· i. 243 penetrare . . . intime

. tatas reyna; i. 349 impius ente eres.

213 Ellipsis—Ellipsis, ie. the omission of vvords necessary to
the grammatica] structure 01 the sentence, is common in Ver·
gil, partly out 01 considerations of metrica] convenience,
partly because the good teste and fine eesthetic sense of the
poet led him to omit words in themselves slight and unem-
phatic and easily supplied irom the context. Note:

214 (1) The omission of pronoun forms, especially from e's, en,
ie. The omission occurs (a) in the predicate, i. 12 Tyrii
renitere coloni (sc. enne); i. 63 premere (sc. eos); 1. 62 inposuit
(se. 013); i. 79 tei dds (se. nini); i. 80 facis (sc. nee) potentem.
- (1)) in the subject, before an infinitive; i. 218 sen (sc. ees) -
nlicere credent.

215 (2) The omission of parts of esse, whether this verb is used
independently or as an auxiliary. Even in prose est, snnt, and
esse (especially with the future infinitive) are freely omitted
and examples 01 such omission in Vergil need not be given.
The poets, however, even omit snm, senens, es, estis, and the
parts 01 ernrn; 1. 558 advent (scentes), ii. 651 effltsi (sernens); i.
237 pollicitus (es), v. 192 nsi (estis). A striking case is the
ellipsis 01 es in a question, i. 329 nn Phoebe soror? nn npnc
phorum snnpnine's nne?

216 (3) The omission of verbs 01 speaking or answering (eit,
dien, respondet), common in all poetry3 1. 37 baec secem (ait,

decet) 3 i. 76 Aeolns ece nnnc (cit or respondet).
