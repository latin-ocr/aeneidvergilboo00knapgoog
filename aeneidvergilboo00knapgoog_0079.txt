2. Tite Orderof words

204 Free Order of Words in Poetry. - Everywhere in Latin the
order of words is less stereotyped than that which is usual in
’ English sentences, partly because a Latin sentence is a word
picture, in which the meaning is developed stroke by stroke,
the various parts being introduced in the order 01 their im-
portance, partly because Latin loves 10 keep the meaning
10 suspense until the very end, so that the last word com-
pletes both the form and the meaning 01 the sentence. The
inflectional system, which alone makes this freedom possible,
helps 10 relieve the very difficulty it meotes, since a competent
knowledge of inflectional forms usually suffices to tell us what
words belong together. Iu verse the order 01 words is 01100
more intricate even than that 01 prose3 the poets, by artistic
placing and grouping 01 words, secure the happiest effecte.
The most emphatic placesin averse are the beginning (except
for the subject, unless this precedes an introductory particle)
and the end (except for the verb). In general, any wide de-
parture from the normal order arrests attention and gives
emphasis to the word not in its normal place. 10 Vergil's
