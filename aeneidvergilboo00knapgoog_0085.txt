on the proper successiones heavy and light syllables.1 In
other words, English rhythm is accentual, the classical rhythm
was quantitative. ’

229 syllables — ln Latin rhythm the unit of measurement is
the light syllable. Bearing in mind the relations once exist
ing between poetry, the march, and the dance (ἕξ 226, 227),
we may fairly represent this by the musical character J. The
heavy syllable has twice the time of a light, and so may be
represented by J . In Vergil these arethe only syllable values
to be considered.

230 sees-As in ordinary speech syllables are combined to
form words, so in verse syllables are combined to form verse-
words, called measureS, or, more often, feet. ln Vergil we
have two kinds of feet, the dactyl and the spondee. The dac-
tyl consiste of a heavy syllable followed by two light sylla-
bles, the spondee of two heavy syllables. In musical notation
the dactyl =J Ν, the spondee =J J. The two feet are
thus completely equivalent, each to the other.

231 Ictus3 Thesis3 Arsia-The first syllable of the dactyl and
the spondee is always more strongly intoned (stressed) than
the others (οἱς 227). ro this stress the name ictas (literally,
‘stroke ') is given. The partos the foot which bears this
ictus is called the thesis ; the unaccented part is called the
arsis. The names thesis and arsis are Greek in origin, and
mean respectively ‘a setting down' and ‘a lifting up·'; thesis
refers to the setting down of the ioot in beating timeor in
marching or to the downward stroke of the hand in beating
time, arsis to the raising of the foot or the hand.

¹ Vosoels are best distinguished as short or lersy, syllables as llylrt or heavy„ Α
light syllable is one whose vowel is short, by nature or position, a heavy syllable
one whose vowel is long, or whose vowel is followedby two consonante, not a mute
and a liquid. For syllables containingavowel followed by a mute arrd a liquid
see ξ 250. Note carefully that a syllable may be heavy though its vowel is short.
It is assumed that the student is familiar with the rules of quantity.
