liberal and discriminating patron of menos letters. Ata
critical period Vergil received substantial help from him. In
his pat'ronage of men of letters, Augustus was ably seconded '
by Maecenas (ξ 14), aman of culture, whose house was a

gathering place for the leading writers of the day. Vergil, ·
Horace, and others were deeply indebted to him; his name ·

has ever since been a synonym for a generous patron and
friend of letters. In those days a patron was more important
than he would be at present, for then there were no copyright
laws, and authors received little, if anything, from the sale of
their works. Hence, one who devoted himself wholly to lit-
erary pursuits was bound to rely on some patron for support,
'unless he possessed an independent fortune. Another patron
of letters was Marcus Valerius Messala, a member of an illus·
trious patrician family. Chief among those who gathered
about him were Tibullus and Ovid.

2⁵ The talents of all these men of letters were, in greater
or less degree, at the service of the government. They
helped to reconcile the people to the new order of things, by .
souuding the Emperor’s· praises, and by contrasting the exist-
ing peace and security with the civil strife and chaos of other ' ¹
days. lt may well be that the encouragement given by
Augustus to literature was du'e more to his perception of its
practical utility to himself than to any regard 'for letters.
He is notthe only absolute monareh who has encouraged
literature from somewhat mixed motives.
