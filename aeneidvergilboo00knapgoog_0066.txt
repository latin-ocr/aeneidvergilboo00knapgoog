Accusative with the ‘Middle' Vcice. - (1) An accusative 1³6
is often coupled with a perfect passive participle which is
construed‚ plainly, as a middle voice (ξ 152) with a direct
object3 i. 228 lacrimis oculos sufflrsa, ‘having dyed her eyes
with tcars’3 i. 320 sinas collecta fluentis, ‘having gathered
her streaming robes'3 i. 481 lansec pectora palmis, ‘heating
their breasts! (2) ln the preceding cases the expressionem
describe an act voluntarily performed hythe subject, ie. they
are substantially transitive. For the first two an ablative
absolute might be substituted. In a few passages, however,
this form of expression is used to denote that the subject,
against his will, suffers some act to be performed on himself;

ii. 273 per pedes traiectus lora tumentis, ‘having had thcngs
passed through,' etc.; ii. 57 mancis . . . posi terya revinctum.

(3) Α similar accusative is found with finite forms of tholae
passive, especially of verbs meaning to clothe; ii. 392 clipei .
ircsiyne decorum induitur, ‘ he puts on his shield with its
fair device' ; ii. 510 inatile ferrum cingitur, ii. 721 umercs

. . . insternor pelle leonis, ‘l spread o’er my shoulders,’ etc.

Ellipsis of Accusative. -The poets and later prose writers 139
often apparently treat as intransitive certain verbs which in
the best prose are transitive. This phenomenon is due to the
ellipsis of apronoun, usually the reflexive se ,· i. 104 coer-tit ,·

i. 402 avertens ,· ii. 235 cccinyuofomncsopcri (buti. 210 illi
ec praedae accingunt).
(4) Tun Anrsrrva

Abletive of Separation and Plane from Which. -The poets 140
use the ablative very freely to denote the source or starting·
point of motion, as well as separation in general. For the
prose use see A. 400-403, 427 ; B. 214, 229 ; G. 390, 3913 H.
461-465. For the ‘ablative of the place whence’ iu Vergil
cf. l. 31 arcebat . . . Latio (= ᾱ Latic); i. 38 halle (=cb
halin) . . . ovomere ,· i. 44 exspirantem . . . pectore (=. ea
