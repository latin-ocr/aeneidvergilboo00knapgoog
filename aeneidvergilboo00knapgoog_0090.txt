short. This is amatter or* metrical convenience, but may also
represent a pronunciation current in popular speech. ‘The

Synizesia—Often two vowels which properly belong to 247

different syllables are amalgamated, i.e. pronounced together
in one syllable. This happens:

(1) In the forms of proper names with nominatives in evis
(ξ 99). In the oblique cases these words are naturally cretics
or end iri cretius (a cretio = - ψ -). This combination is,
of course, utterly impossible in hexameter verse. 'fhe synize-

cretic. Such are aere} (twice), alvei} (four times), cure}

simii (vi. 200).
