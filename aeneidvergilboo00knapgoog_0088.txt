[ιι these and many others there is absolutely no break in the
sense, yet the verse-pause is clearly defined The reading of
an hexameter verse has well been likened to climbing a hill,
testing a moment on the summit, and theu descending the
other side.

’.1110 maerens-Sometimes the verse-pause comes at the 237
'end of the fourth foot3 this is called the bucolic diaeresis,1
because it rs most frequentin pastoral poetry (5 46) It1s
not common, however,' ιιι any Lat' tm poet. Furt ther, the
bucolic diaeresis rs usually accompanied by a penthemimeral
caesura (§ 235). ἶ

Word Acuent - Ιιι the last two feet, word accent (ie. the 238
accent which aword has in common speech) and the verse
aocent or ictus usually coincide. In the other feet they are
commonly different. The Romans m such cases carefully
brought out both accents. We do this often m English verse
In the following couplet tthe dots beneath the line mark the
ictus, the marks over the words the word· accent.

Hennes well too who keeps that clue the mild
Blrth- goddess and the aust tere Fates flrst gave.

Here the two accents repeatedly stand side by side3 in the
second verse the juxtaposition in one caseis the more note-
worthy because it is due to an intentional change in the
pronunciation of arctare.

In reading Vergil's hexameters, therefore, we must respect
both the* word accent and the verse accent or ictus As helps
toward the attainment of skill in such reading we should
minimize the stress given to the verse aocent and pay the ¹
most careful attention to the quantity of the various vowels
and syllables. The attempt to preserve the two sets of ac·
cents is not easily successful, but all possible effert should
be made ιιι this direction.2
