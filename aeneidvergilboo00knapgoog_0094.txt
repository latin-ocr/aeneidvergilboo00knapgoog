from older poets, others in onomatopoetic verses (§ 224), the
poet aiming at some particular effect. Examples are:

(1) Imitations of older poets3

iii. 12 c'um sociis natoque Penatibus et magnls dis

(2) Onomatopoeti03
1105 dat latus, 1nsequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae mons

Inoomplete Verses. -There are in the Aeneid fifty-fouraez
incomplete verses. Two explanatione of their presence have
been offered: (1) that they are due to the fact that tho

Aeneid was left in an unfinished condition (§ 50>3 (2) that
they are intentional variations from metrical uniformity. In ’
lavor of the latter it is urged that in general these lines are

complete in sense. Examples of incompleta verses arc i. 534,
560, 636, ii. 66, 233, 468, 614, 623, 640.

or more in the samc verse or in adjacent verses, thc tendency
among Latin poets seems to be to give such words and forms
different metrioal treatment unless some special effect of
emphasis exultation, pathos, or the like is to be gained
through repetition with the same metrical value. Sometimes
both mathods are combined. Examples are:

(1) Different metrica] treatment; 264
