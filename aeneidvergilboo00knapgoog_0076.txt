AdJective msteed of Genitive οἱ Noun -adn adjective, espe— 191
cially one derived from a proper name, is sometimes used
instead of the genitive of a noun or instead oi some phrase
or clause3 i. 665 lelc Typhoia, ‘the weapons wherewith
Typhoeus was slain'3 i. 200 Scyllaeam (ε Scyllae) reblam
vii. 1 Ascalo (= Aeaeae) amma.

Formulaic Epithets-In imitation of the Homeris usage 192
certain standing epithets are attached to the names of certain
persons; thus Aeneas is pius or mdpccclmus; Iulus is
pulcher ,· Achates is sadus ,· Messapus is ecum (= equorum)
domitor.

Proleptic Epithets—An epithet attached to a substantive 193
sometimes anticipates the action of the verb with which the
substantive is associated as subject or object3 the epithet
really gives the result oi the action of the verb. Such epi· .
thets are called proleptic‚ ‘ anticipating! of. i. ota-660 ut
. . . furentem incendat reparcam, ‘that he may tire the queen
to mad passion’3 ii. 135 obsecras . . . deliaca, ‘I hid myself
and remained soreened from view'; iii. 141 sterilis exerere Α
. . . cyrds, ‘burned the fields to barrenness' In none of
these passages is the adjective or participle in place till the
action of the verb is completed.

Transferred epitheta —Instead of appending an epithet to 19⁴
a word denoting a person or thing poete often attach it tc a
word denoting some part of that person or thing, or· something
intimately associated therewith‚ or scine actos the person
which exhibits the quality in question. Sometimes an epi-
thet is applied to an object which denotas not any quality of
the thing itself but rather the effect it produces in other
things or in persons. In studiis asperrimo lolli i. 14, asper· ’
almo belongs in thought with studiis, not with Carthago ,¹ in
i. 224 more velivolum, the adjective is one properly applied
⁷ tc ships, not'to the sea; in iii. 44 cradelts terras . latas
