· ³08 omens and Portenta -The second way in which the gods
conduct their dealings with mortals is through omens and
portents. The terms employed to denote these manifestatione

, cf the divine will are portentum, canestrum, omen, oupurium.
η The practice of attaching importanee to various phenomena,
especially unusual phenomena, receives endorsement from
the words put into the mouth of Venus (i. 390-400), when she
makes predictions to Aeneas concerning the weltere ot' his
fleet from the actions of a flock cf swans, declaring that she
can assure him of the safety of his ships, ‘unless her foolish
parents have taught her augury to no purpose! cf the many
omens and signs mentioned in the Aeneid only a few need be
noted here. Dido and her followers, on reaching the site of
Carthago, dig up there the head of a spirited charger and
know at once, from something Iuno had told them, that this
was the place where they were to build their city (i. 441 ff).
The snakes which destrcy Laocoon and his sons, after Laocoon
has darted a spear into the side of the wooden horse, are
regarded as a monstrum, as proof of the anger of the gods at
the act of Laoccdn (ii. 199-231). When Anchises is firmly
set in his purpose not to flee from Troy, a monstrum makes
him waver; bright flames play about the head of his grandson
Ascanius, without, however, harming the hoy (ii. 680-686).
³09 We may note in connection with the last named monstrum
that it is not regarded as constituting in itself a sufficient
indicationes the divine will. Anchises, though favorably
impressei, yet hesitates‚ and eries to Iuppiter,

Dat deinde auxilium, pater, atque haec omina firma.

Sc, at the grave of Polydorus Aeneas, troubled by the sight of
the blood that trickles forth from the myrtle shafts, begs Mars
and the woodland nymphe to ‘ give a favorable turn to the sight
and to lighten the omeu’ (iii. 3436). Often, however. the
omen is at cuce intelligible, having been antrcrpated by some
utterance or prophecy of the gods or their human spohesmen.
