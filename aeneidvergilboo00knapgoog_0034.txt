sources 01 our Knowledge. —Vcrgil tells us little aboutss
Ἰ himself. Some information is derived from casual notices in

other writers, especially Horace (ἓ 28). Horace makes clear,
sor instance, the depth cf Vergil’s devoticnto his friends and
his power of inspiring in his contemporaries a warm love for
himself. We have also several biographies by later Roman
writerS, chief of which is that by Aelius DonatuS, a gramma
