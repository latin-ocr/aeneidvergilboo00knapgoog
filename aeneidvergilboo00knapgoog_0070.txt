Nora-The complementary infinitivo often virtuslly expresses purpose, espe-
oially in the cases grouped under §§ 162, 164.

The Complementary Infinitive.— Even in prose many verbs 160
take an infinitivo to complete their meaning. Suoh are (1)
verbs expressing power, duty, inclination, purpose, effert,
beginning, and their opposites(possum, queo, nequeo, volo, nelo,
eonor, incipio, coepe, debeo), and (2) verbs denoting willingness
and permission‚ or the opposite ideas of hindranoe, prevention
(patior, sino, 111191, oete, prohibeo). The poets go mueh
further, making the infinitivo depend on many verbs whioh
do not properly require any complement, or which, if in a
given instance they should require one, would naturally find
itin some form of expression other than the infinitive. The
poets were here in¹ part extending construetione familiar in ⁵
prose, in part imitatiug Greek syntax, in whioh the infinitivo ’
was more freely used than in Latin. Even iu prose, equiva-
lent expressions take the same construetion3 when dieo· = ‘to
oommaud' (ol. impero, leonton) it is followedby the subjunc-
tive. So in poetry‚ when ordeo =eetementer eolo, it is fol-
lowed hythe infinitivo. The verbs used in Vergil with the ,
complementary infinitive in a way to require attention may be
roughly elassified as follows:

a. expressione of Will, Desire, Effert, or tte opposite

(1) Willingness or unwillingness3 i. 66 marenae dedit floo- 161 ·

liumque pati ,· iv. 19211 se . . . dignetur (ί condescends') '
‘iungere Dide ,· vii. 433 11 dure eonninyinm et dieto parere

(2) Preferenoe, concern, desire, passion, and the opposite3162
