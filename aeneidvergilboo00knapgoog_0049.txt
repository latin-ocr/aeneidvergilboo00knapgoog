very briefly traced its history among the Greeks and the
Romans An θρίω ροθ111 is a narrative poem, one that tells a
story, usually of considerable length. The story must be
dignified in character, and must be told in noble, impressive
language, and in sonorous, majestic verse. An θρίω ροθ111
ought to possess unity, that is, the events of the story should
form a connected series and conduce to a common end. An
θρίω thus differs from a history, whose business it is to include
all the events of a given period, even though many of them
are in no way related to one another. Originally, θρίω poems
were concerned only with the goda, praising their power,
reciting their exploitS, and relating various myths concerning
them. Later, their scope was broadeued so as to include the
> deeds of demigodS, and finally those even of mor-tals.

perfect specimens of Greek θρίω poetry are the sccalled
Homeric poema, the Iliad and the Odyssey. The former
deals with certain events of the last year of the siege of Troy
(ἓ 51), but does not describe the capture of the city. In the
Odyssey the capture is taken for granted, and the Greek

’ chieftains are on their way home. The only leader, how·
ever, whose fortunes are followed in detail is Odysseus (or
Ulixes as the Romans called him); everything has to do
with his safe return to his horne and his restoration to his
kingdom.

tanee among the θρίω poets of Grcece are the cyclic poeta, so
called because their works, being introducticns to the Homeri'c
poems or supplements thereto, formed, with the Iliad and the
Odyssey, a complete cycle of the legends connected with the
siege of Troy and the events following the capture of the
city. These poets lived in the eighth to the sixth centurias
before Ghrist. Of the later Greek θρίω poets the most impor-
tant was hpollonius Rhodius, born at Alexandria about 260,
