home, had its Vesta, its Lar, and its Penates. In the Atriam
Vestae at Rome a fire was kept always burning by the Vesta]
Virgins. 'In Vergil’s time the belief was current that the
Penates of the Roman state had been brought by Aeneas from
'l'roy to Lavinium. Representations ol the Penates similar to ,
these were sacredly kept in a special shrine in the alimum
Vestae. At the very outset of the Aeneid (i. 5) Aeneas’s
purpose is described as twofold, to build a city and to· bring
his gods into Italy. In ii. 296 the spirit of Hector brings to
Aeneas ‘Vesta and Vesta's neverdying fire.' Aeneas (iii. 11),
speaking oi his departure from the land of Troy, says ‘l
move out upon the deep, an exile with my comrades, my son,
, the Penates, and the mighty gods'

399 In this connection it is worth while to dwell a moment on
a point of importance to a right understanding of the ancient
conceptions concerning the gods. The ancients found it ex·
tremely difficult, in fact, impossible to separate the statue of
a deity from the deity itself. Where the statue of the god
waS, there was the god. Langnage is used, therefore, natur·
ally enough, of the statue which, strictly speaking, is appro-
priate only to the god (ii. 172 ff). The loss or destruction of
'the statue meant the loss of the favor of the deity which it
represented. From this brief statement we can understand at
once why Aeneas sought to carry the statues of Vesta, the
Penates and the other gods with him in his llight from Troy.
The permanence of Trojan destinies was thought to depend
on the preservation of these statues. The transference ot tha
statues to the new home of the Trojan race was the one sure
means of securing the favor of the gods they represented for
the career which the racc wasto enjoy in the promised land.
