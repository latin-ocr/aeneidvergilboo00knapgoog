Infinitives with adjectiva, -In prose but one adjective, 169
perdtus, is freely used with the infinitive. In verse, largely
again as the result of Greek influenoe, the infinitivo is freely
used with the participles oi the verbs considered in ἓξ 161-
168, with adjectives derived from those verbs, and, lastly,
with any adjective expressing will, desire, capacity, skill,
fitneps, or the opposite. The infinitivo is often virtually an
ablativo oi specification with the participle or adjective. ef.

vii. 806 adsueto . . . proelia ciryci dero poti cursuque pedum
praevertere ventes ,¹ vi. 164 qne non praestantior alter aare ciere
vires (erot); ix. 772 qud nen felicior (‘ more skillful’) alter
unyncrc iila manti ferrumque armdre υθηὲηός xii. 527 neseio
vinei pectora. ἲ

Infinitive with ronna -Vergil ireely uses the infinitive 1⁷0
nith nouns, especially with verbal nouns oi meanings akin to
those of the verbs with which the complementary infinitive is
joined3 ii. 10 si tantus amor (cst) coistis ocpnesocrc nostres ,· ii. ι
575 subit ira cadentem ulcisci patmum, ‘the angry desire
sweeps o'er me,' etc. So with amoriii. 298 ; potestas iii. 67ος
cero vi. 654, 6553 spes v.183; cupide vi. 133. Prose would
have used the genitive of the gerund instead of the infinitive.

Past Partieiples with Present Foree. -Vergil at times 1⁷1
seems to use the past passive participle, especially of depc-
nent verbs, with the force of apresent, ie. as expressive of
contemporaneous, not antecedent, time and action. This nse
seems in part an imitation of the Greek present participle
middle (ξ 152), in part the result of an attempt to replaoe the
missing present participle passive. ef. i. 155 innectus, ⁶ rid-
ing ’ς i. 481 tensae, ‘beating' 3 v. 766 complexi inter se, ‘em-
braoing one another²; vi. 335 vectes, ‘as they were sailing⁷3
v. 708 solatiis, ‘ comforting) Some prose formulae approach
thionne, e. g. serves allectitiis dixit
