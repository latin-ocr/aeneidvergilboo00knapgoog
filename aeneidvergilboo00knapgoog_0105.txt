291 Deiues of Forest and riola -Not only the waters but the
foreste also were peopled with deities3 in fact, every place
had its own peculiar god or goddess Nympha is the general
name for such deitieS, as well as for the fountain goddesses
(ξ 290). 111 111. 34 Aeneas worships the nymphae cyrestes, in
consequence of the strange happenings attendant upon his
attempt to gather the shafts of cornel and of myrtle. On
reaching the island of Ortygia, near Syracuse in Sicily, the
Trojans worship the camina mayoc loci (iii. 697). A signifi·
cant passage is vii. 136 ff. The Trojans are come at last to
Italy ; an incident, trifling in itself but important as fulfilling
in innocent fashion a prediction which had sadly disturbed

fully, therefore, they invoke the gods in prayer, among others
the nymphae and the penius loci, ie. the god under whose

(vii. 763), Feronia, at Anxur (vii. 800), Carmentis, a nymph of

Evander, the Arcadian hero who founded the city of Pallan-
teum (ὅ 57), ¹and Marica, a nymph at Laurentum, wife 01 the
woodland god Faunus and mother of Latinus (vii. 47).

293 Saturum Faunus— Deities 01 forest and field, of more im·

Saturnus and Faunus. Saturnus, as has been said above
(ᾗ 275), was identified by Vergil with Cronos. Faunus,
