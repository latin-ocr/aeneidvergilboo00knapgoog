66 INTROBUCTION

avorum, the cruelty and the greed are really those of Poly-
rnestor. So ini. 202 maestam timorem, the timor is not itself
sad; it is so called because it saddens the Troy'ans.

195 Adiective in Adverbial Senta—Adjectives are freely used
in the predicate of a sentence where English employs an
adverb or adverbial phrase. cf. i. 296 fremet horridus ore
omreoto; iii. 529 spirate secunda— Vergil is especially fond of
using an adjective in this way in connection with an attribu-

, tive participle; 11170 lenda crepitans . . . Auster ; v. 27 8
sibila colla arduus attollens ; v. 7 64 creber . . . adspirans . . .
Acestem viii. 559 inexpletus lacrimans.

196 Partioiples and Adjeotives 001101010- (1) Vergil often uses
the neuter of the perfect passive participle as anoun; i. 37
incepto ; 1. 136 commissa 5 i. 142 dicto; 1. 302 iussa. This
use belongs chiefly to poetry and post-classioal prose. (2)
The substantiva] use of neuter adjectives is far commoner in
prose than that of participles, but even here the poets go

’ beyond the limite kept by prose3 i. 308 carcalla, ‘wastes ’3 1.
110 0101ίό10 brevia; i. 219 carticino,¹ iii. 422 ic abruptum,
‘into the abyss ' ; vi. 241 supervacaneam, ‘the vaulted heaveus
o'erhead.'

197 The poets often couple a partitive genitive with neuter par-
ticiples or adjectives thus used as nouns3 i. 4220001000-
rum ; 11. 332 Ι0090010 01010110; 11. 725 opdcc locorum,¹ v. 695
ardua terrorum vi. 633 opaca ciarum i. 384 Libyae deserto.
Often by this device the characteristic quality of an object is
brought into greater prominence3 strata claram, opaca locorum,
aequata ciorum are more effective phrases than the prosaic
stratos vicis, opaca loca, anyrcstds cide.

198 Et‚·que‚ ac, atque. —Three uses of these conjunctiora deserve
attention. These are:

(1) The explicative or explanatory use3 in this the par
tioles introduce some particular or detail illustrative of a
general word or statement, and may be rendered, ‘and in par-
ticular! cf. i. astutiam . . . Laviniaque litora ; i. 30 Danaum
atquc immitis Actius. -
