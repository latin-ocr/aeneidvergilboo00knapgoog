man. He established the first public library at Rome, and

to profit by their criticisms. He was Vergil's first patron and
life-long friend.

³1 Gallus3 Tibullum Propertius. -Another form of poetry
much cultivated in Vergil's day is the kind known as elegiae.
Striotly, the term elegy denotes'a short mournful song, accom-
panied by the fiute. Later, it was applied to a wide variety
of songs, grave or gay, written in a certain meter, and later
still to sentimental love poems. Writers of elegias, in this
last sense, in the Augustan age, were Cornelius Gallus, Albius
Tibullus, and Sextus Propertius. Like Polli0, Gallus was a
manos affairs as well as a poet; 'ne served under Octavianus at
Actium, and later was governor of Egypt, but lost the favor
of Augustus and committed 'suicide Tibullus lived from
about 54 to 18. Four books of elegies are extant under ¹his
name, but some of the poems in them were certainly not
written by him. Propertius too,wrote four books of elegies.

82 ovid-Publius Ovidius Naso was bom among the Pae·
ligni, at Sulmo, 11143. He was well educated and early

especially such as involve a change or transformation from
one form of existence to another, and Festi, in six books,a
calendar in verse, describing the nature and origin of the
festivals celebrated on various days. We have also a number
of love poems written by him. He outlived AugustuS, dying
