arouped into lines or verses. In the formos verse used by
Vergil six feet are grouped in each line3 the verse is there·
fore known as hexameter, ‘six-measured.’ In odnsequenoe of
the prominenoe of the daetyl in this verse, at least in its
Homerio forms,1 the verse is known also as daetylio. Thus
the full title ol the verse is daetylio hexameter.

Infinite variety is possible in the grouping of the daetylsaaa
and the spondees whioh go to make up the verse. Some re-
strictions, however, are to be noted. The last foot is regularly
a spondee3 the fifth foot is usually a daetyl. The daetyl and
the spondee may be used at will in the first four feet. The
scheme of the daetylio hexameter will thus be aa follows:

Lm) Lm) Lux) Lm.) Low L

or or or or seldom or
- L - L - (L L> L υ
(i 234)

A verse with a spondeo in the fifth foot is oalled spondai03
suoh' verses are rare and end usually in aword of four· syl·
lables. A preponderanee of daetyls gives to a verse a light,
graoeful, rapid movement; a preponderanoe ol spondees gives
aslow, solemn, stately movement. . .

Syllaba Anceps. -In theory (§ 233) the last syllable should 234
be heavy, but in praetioe many hexameters end in syllables
whioh are in themselves light, but are treated as heavy to suit
the requirements of the verse. Sinoe the last syllable may, .
apparently, be heavy or light at the poet's will, without regard
to the theoretioal requirements of the metrioal scheme, it is
commonly known as the syllaba arroepa ‘the doubtful (un-
fixed) syllable? The symbol for the syllaba anceps in the
daetylio hexameter is ξς the lower marking indicates the
syllable theoretieally required, the upper the permissible
substitute.
