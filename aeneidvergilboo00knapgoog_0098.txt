whom she had herself created. They had twelve gigantic
children, called the Titans (Titanes), whom Uranus feared so
greatly that he imprisoned them in a dark abyss beneath the
earth, called Tartarus, Presently, however, one of the Titans, 2⁷⁴
Cronos, aided by his mother, overpowered Uranus and de·
throned him. He then released the Titans and gave them
portions of the·universe to govern. Cronos married his sister
Rhea (also called Cybele), but was soon dethroned by his son
Jupiter. Some of the Titans, led by Cronos, fought against
Jupiter, but were defeated. Cronos now withdrew to Italy,
and founded there a prosperous kingdom over which he¹
reigned in peace for many yearS, under the name Saturn.
Various giants now assailed Jupiter, among them Typhoeus,
from whose eyes, mouths (he had a hundred dragon heads),
and nostrils flames flashed. Another was Enceladus, who, on
his defeat, was imprisoned in a burning cave beneath Mount
Aetna Henceforth Jupiter’s supremacy was unquestioned. '
He and his brothers now divided by lot the dominions of
Cronos3 Neptune secured the sovereignty of the sea and all
waters, Pluto of the underworld, Jupiter of heaven, together
with a general supervision over the provinces of his brothers.

Of these traditions we get some echoes in the Aeneid. In2'75
lv. 166 Tellus is described aspriora, which is usually taken to
mean ‘oldest of the gods! In iv. 178 Terra is parens. In
vi. 580 the Titans are called pertus euticam Terrae, ‘sons of
earth born in days of old! Elsewhere Vergil makes Rhea
mother of the gods, calling her meque deum penetres ii. 788,
Cybebe (= Cybele) x. 220, and Berecyntia nemer (from Bere-
cyntos, a mountain in Phrygia, sacred to Cybele or Rhea)
vi. 784. According to iii. 111 ff. her worship was brought
to Troy from Crete. There are references to Typhoeus (i. .
665, ix. 716), and to Enceladus (iii. 57 8 ff.) The Italian god
Saturnus is identified by Vergil with Cronos3 his rule in Italy

and the Golden Age inaugurated by him there are more than ,
once referred to (i. 569, vi. 793, vii. 17 8 ff, 203, viii. 319 ff.)
