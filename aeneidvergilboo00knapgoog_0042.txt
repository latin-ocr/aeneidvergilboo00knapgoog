spending the winter of the sixth year in western Sicily they
set sail again for Italy, which they might reasonably bave

Aeneas and Dido. —It isat this point that the Aeneidos
begins. The prows of the Trojan ships are pointed toward
Italy, and the hearts of Aeneas and his followers beat high
with hope. This hope, however, is destined to cruel disap
pointment. J uno, the wife of Jupiter and queen of the godS,
had long‘h'ated the Trojans, for reasons which may be briefly
stated. Some time before the siege of Troy began, a dispute
arose between three goddesses June, Minerva, and Venus, as
to which was the fairest. The gods, cautiously declining to
decide the question, referred it to Paris (ἓ 51), then dwelling
as a shepherd on Mt. Ida, near Troy. Before him, therefore,
the goddesses appeared, each secking to enhanoe the charin of
*her beauty by dazzling promises of favors to come if hc would
decide in her favor. Minerva offered him wisdom, Juno
wealth and power, aud Venus the most beautiful woman in
the world as his wife. He deoided in favor of Venus aud
received his reward in Helen. duno, angered by her defeat, 54

hatred. She gave the Greeks substantial aid in the siege of
. Troy. Now she induces Aeolus, king of the winde, to cause
a mighty storm, which destroys one of Aeneas's ships and
scatters the others far and wide. Aeneas with seven vessels

seek an' audience with her. On reaching Carthage he finds
there messengers from the missing ships, bound on the same
errand as himself. Dido welcomes the Trojans, offers them a
horne in her city, and entertains them at a splendid banquet.
