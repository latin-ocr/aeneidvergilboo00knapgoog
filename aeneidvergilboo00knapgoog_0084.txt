Meter or Rhythm — Meter or rhythm is the distinguishingaae
mark of poetry. Once three arto-poetry, music, ard dan·
cing -were very closely united. All three had to do <with
relations of time3 all three were governed by the same prin· Δ
ciple, harmony. ‘ Harmony consists in repetition, just as
two or more parallel lines agree or harmoniae· because one
repeats the conditione of the. other. So in poctry, or music,
or dancing, a certain succession of accentu, or notes or steps
is repeated, thus establishing the relation of harmony! This
use of harmony, when reduced to a system, is called rhythm
or meter.

'l'he origin of Meter-We know that dance and march22'1
alilre are divided into equal measures and that each of these
measures begins witha movement of the body slightly more
vigorous than those which accompany the remaining parts
of the measure. Hence, in the days when song and dance
and march were intimately associated (ξ 226), it was of
course necessary that the song too should bc divided into
equal measures and that the beginning of each measure
should be more forcibly intoned, to correspond to the more
vigorous movement of the body in the dance or march. In
this way was developed the fundamental requirement of
rhythmical or metrical composition, namely‚ that what is
said shall be divided into equal measures, the first part of
each measure having a special stress or ictus.

to secure metrical effecto. In English, for instance, rhythm
