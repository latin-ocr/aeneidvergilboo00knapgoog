statue is a copy oi the famous statue known as the Venus of

20. Laocoon .................... 182

See cn ii. 233. The group when found was somewhat
mutilated; in some respecta the restoration is erroneous.
For example, the right hand of Laocodn ought to be resting
on the back of his head. The group was the work oi three
sculptors oi the island of Rhodes, about the end oi the sec·
ond century Β. 0. The elder son hasstill a chance to escape,
but he seems more concerned with his iathar's iate than
with his own; Laocodn is still struggling, though he has
been forced down to the altar and is putting forth his last
strength; the younger son has already succumbed, and his
hand rests helplessly on the head oi the serpent thathee
caused his death. The moment seizad by the sculptors it
will be seen, does not correspond in all respacts to the
account given, a century later, by Vergil
