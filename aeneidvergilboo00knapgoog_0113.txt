ricus, often misunderstood by those to whom they were deliv-
ered3 an instance is found in Book Ill, where Anchises
misintcrprets the answer to Aeneas’s prayer. The god’s

answer was: antiquam acquirite matrem, ‘ Seek your ancient
mother,' i. e. Seek the cradle of your race; sec iii. 96. The
god had Italy in mind, Anchises thought of Crete (cf. iii. 103
ff. with iii. 180 ff).

³1³ Medma—Another means whereby mortals learned the
will of the gods was formed by dreams and visions. Vergil
mentions two gates one of horn, the other of ivory, by which

, dreams make their way from the underworld to this (ri. 893-
896). By the former gate real spirits issue, to appear to
mortals in sleep, by the other misleading apparitions come
forth. Here Vergil is following Homer. When the Greeks
have forced an entrance into Troy through the stratagem of
the wooden horse, Hector appears in a vision to Aeneas and
bids him flee, at the same time commending to him his coun-
try's gods (ii. 270 ff.). When the Trojans7 misunderstanding
the oracle delivered to them at Delos (t 312), settle in Crete,
they suffer grievously in consequence of their mistake. Pres-
.ently, the Penates (55296-298) appear to Aeneas as he lies
in sleep, and tell him that Italy, not Crete, was the land
meant by Apollo (iii. 147 ff.). After Aeneas had at last
resolved to quit Carthage‚a figure, like in all respects to
Mercurius, appears to him in his sleep, to urge him to instant
departure (iv. 556 ft). A dream-oraclo is described at length
in vii. 81 ff. Here the priest makes a sacrifice cf sheep and
lays him down to sleep on the skins of the wictims3 as he
slumbers ‘he sees strange sights and hears various voices and
enjoys converse with the gods'
