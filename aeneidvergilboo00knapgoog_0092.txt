contraction. Hiatus between words was usually removed in
poetry by elision (‘ erushing out') of the final vowel of the
first word. similarly, a vowel before lv was elided; ltneces·
sarily stands between vowels and since it was virtually not
sounded the one vowel really came direotly before the other.
lf a word ended in m preceded by a vowel, both mand the
vowel were elided. · This form of elision is sometimes called
eclrthlipsis. Its explanation is simple; final ct was but
lightly pronounced, so that a word-ending in m practioally
ended in a vowel sound. Examples of elision are as follows:

(1) Of simple vowel; i. 3 multum illeiis terris ,· i. 5 mittha 253
qooqoe'lt bello possus ,· i. 7 otqaedltoc moenio Romae.
(2) Of ct and the preceding vowel; i. 3 moltura ille,- i. 22 254

(3) Of a vowel, or m and preceding vowel, before b, i. 332 2⁵5

Nora. —Autborities are not agreed as to how the elided part is to be
treated in reading the verse. Some think that the two words were
slurred together in some way, others that the elided part was entirely
omitted. The former method ean not be employed at all in the many cases
involving elision at a deeided caesura.

averse with a syllable ending in a vowel that must be elided
before an initial ¹vowel in the following verse. This linking
together of two verses is called synapheia. In one case the
verse ends in ct preceded by a vowel, both of which are
elidad before the following verse. Such verses since they
seem to have one syllable too many, are called hypermetric
verses. In most cases the hypermetric syllable is the enclitie
