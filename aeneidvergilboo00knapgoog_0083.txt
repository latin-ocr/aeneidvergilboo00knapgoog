letter, usually a consonant, at the beginning of successive or
adjacent words or syllables, is highly characteristic of the
native Italian poetry.. That poetry was fond of jingles and
assonanoes 81 811 88118, 18 some extent it employed rhyme.
In some prosc writers, 188, alliteration is not uncommon. The
Augustan poets, however, following Greek practice, nse ellit
oration sparingly. Many good examples newertheless‚ arc
to be found in Vergil; i. 55 81119116 curn murmure 81811111,
1. 8188118111 8811181811 cuspide montem impulit ; i. 124 mayoc
misceri murmure ; i. 214 tum 818111 revocant 81118.

224 onomatopoeia-Like all true poets Vergil repeatedly acts
in the spirit of the rule that in poetry the sound should seem
an e'cho of the sense, for often 118 18 plainly secking by the
sound of the words he employs to impress an idea more
forcefully upon the reader’s mind. We must not forget that
Latin poetry, thanks largely to the practice 81 public recita
tions (5 30), was addressed as much to the ear as to the eye.
Onomatopoetic verses are to be found everywhere in Vergi13

22⁵ Vergils Ι1111881181.- 111 many cases Vergil does not din
rectly convey information or supply all 1118 details which
go to make up a picture or which belong to a given event, but
allows the reader to draw inferences or supply details for
himself. This is part 81 the poet's art; in 8 long poem a full
narration 81 details would often be most wearisome. Resides,
there are many matters 81 (181811 which Vergil might well
have despaired 81 treating with the dignity proper 18 an apic
poem. In i. 130 Vergil does not ray explicitly that Neptune
attributed to Juno the storm which has just harassed the
TrojanS, but one feels instinctively that such is his meaning.
For other instances of this trait -which for want of a better
name we may perhaps call ‘indirection’-see the notes on
