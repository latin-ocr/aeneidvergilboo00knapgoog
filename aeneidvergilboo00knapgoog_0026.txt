as the champion of all that was for the best interests of
Rome. Popular disgust at Antony's conduct was increased
by the disastrous failure, in 36, of his expedition against the
Parthians. Meanwhile Octavianus had won public estecm
not only by establishing a firm government in ltaly, but also
⁵ by winning successes in defence of Roman soil, either person-
ally or through his lieutcnantS, in Dalmatia, illyria, and on
the Alpine fronticr. .
By 33 it was plain that war between Octavianus and12

Antony could not long be averted. When the second term of
the Triumviratc (ξ 9) expired the agreement was no't renewed.
Finally, when Titius and Plancus, officers of Antony, deserted
him and revealed the fact that in his will he had bestowed
upon Cleopatra and his children by her the treasures and the
domain of Rome, popular feeling forced Octavianus into a
declaration of war. With consummate skill, however, Octa
vienus caused this declaration to be made against Cleopatra,
thus putting himself into the position of one defending his
country against a foreign foe, and Antony into that of one
supporting a foreigner against his fatherland. The opposing
forces met at Actium, September 2, 31. The result of the
naval fight there is well known. Antony and Cleopatra fled
to Alexandria, and, finding resistance hopeless, shortly after-
wards committed suicide. Octavianus reduced Egypt to the
form of a province, which he kept under his own direct con·
trol. Hc was now undisputed master of the Roman world.
He did not at once return to Rome, but spent nearly two years
in the east, arranging its affairs, especially those cf dudea.
