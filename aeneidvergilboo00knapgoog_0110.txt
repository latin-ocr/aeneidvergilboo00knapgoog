(10110101 statement -Vergil follows Homer in representing 306
the gods as coming 111 various ways into close contact with ,
mortale. He makes Evander (5 57) say that his subjecte
believe that they have repeatedly seen Iuppiter himself, shak-
ing his cepis (ξ 279) and setting the storin in motion (viii.
352). The gods have favorite haunts on earth which they
love to visit3 thus 111110 loves Carthage (i. 15 ff), Venus
Paphos (i. 415 11.) To certain favored mortale the gods re-
veal themselves and their will by (1) persona] intercourse,
(2) , signs, such as oracles, omens, and dreams.

Personal Intercourse of the Gods with 111011-11111 58911001
we read that Venus appears to Aeneas ‘more clearly than e⁷er
she had revealed herself heretcfore, 111 the guise and in the
greatness which are hers among the dwellers in heaven.² She
takes away the mist from before his eyes and enables him to see
divers gods — Neptunus, Iuno, Pallas, and luppiter himself -·
actively engaged in the work of destroying Troy. Later,
Venus appears 10 Aeneas as he goes forth to explore the land
01 Carthago (ξ 54); this time she is disguised as a huntress,
yet her divine nature is not wholly concealed. Her son,
however, does not recognize her till she turns to leave him
(i. 40211.) Later still Venus brings in person to Aeneas the
arms which Vulcan had fashioned 101 him (viii. 608). No
other instance 01 her appearance to Aeneas is recorded, but her
care 101 his interests does not cease. When he is wounded,
she speedily cures the hurt; she puts into his mind the plan
which brings his struggle with Turnus to a triumphant close.
Apollo comes down from heaven to congratulate Ascanius on .
his first warlilre achievement3 he assumes the form 01 Β11100,
once armor-bearer to Anchisea but the Trojan chiefs recog-
nize the god (ix. 644-660). In other cases the gods deal with
mortale through messengers, Mercurius (ς 286) being the ’
messenger 01 Iuppiter, Iris (§ 278) 01 Ι11110.
