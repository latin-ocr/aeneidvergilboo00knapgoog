· THE GRAMMAR Am> smu OF VERGIL ’ 47

Second homusion-The genitive plural is made in om,89
not -orum, very frequently in nouus, rarely in adjectives5
deum i. 93 Danaum i. 303 Argivum i. 403 superma i. 43 md
pachimum vi. 307. The form in «um is the older; that in
-omrm was made after the pattorn of forms in orum in the
first declension‚ and did not win general acceptance until
Cicero's time. In fact, in some words, chiefly words connected
with trade, like nummus, it never displaoed the older form
inum.

Third Declension. —The accusative singular ol certain com· 90
mon nouus horrowed from the Greek ends in a, the accusative
plural in -as ,· deva i. 3003 aethera i. 379; cratera iii. 525;
lebetas iii. 466. These forms are Grecisms, being modeled ⁹
on the normal forms of the accusative in the Greek conso
nantal declension. ·

Fourth Ileclension. -The dative singular ends in -ῑι instead 91
os -ai ,· meta i. 257 ; porta iii. 292; carra iii. 541. —The geni·
tive plural ends in -um instead of -uum ,· currum vi. 653.

Pronouns. —In pronouns a few forms deserve notice: (1) 92
our, oua for aar, trra, an archaism, i. 254, iv. 105, vr. vso; ’
(2) quis = quibus, i. 95, v. 511. This form is not uncommon
in poetry, but in prose belongs to early or colloquial style3
(3) mi = milri, vi. 104, 123.

General statement— The proper names in the Aeneid are93
mostly Greek in origin. In Latin prose such names are usu·
ally declined after Latin models; the poots‚ however, ire ,
quently prefer Greek modes oi declining such words. ln ’
Vergil, on the whole, the Latin forms predominate. For
a general survey of the declcnsion of Greek words and names
seeA. 44, 52, 81-83; B. 22, 27, 47 ; G. 65, 663 Η. 81, 89,
109, 110. Some one of these accounts should be carefully
studied; that in G. is especially convenient. A few points
may be emphasized here.
