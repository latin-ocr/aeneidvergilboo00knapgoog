1. The Use of Words

(1) Nouus

172 Collective Singular. -Words which in themselves denote
buta single thing are at times used as collective nouus, with
plural force; i. 449 foribus cardo stridebat acaia· i. 400'pleno·
subit ostia vuele. This singular occurs especially in proper
names; vi. 851 Eumene ,· viii. 7 06 omnis Arabs, side by side
with omnes . . . Sabaei.

. 173 Plural for singular. —Much more common is the use of the

plural where in prose we should have the singular. This is

often a matter of metrical convenience or dne to a striving
for rhetorical effect. Often‚ too, the plural is used because
the idea is essentially plurales suggestive of parts, crof sepa-
rate units making up a whole (cf. the familiar arina, castra),

or of repetition. We may note:
174 (1) Plural for metrical convenience; i. 61 montes insuper
altos ; i. 730 silentiu ; ii. 706Ι incendia ; vi. 377 solacia. In

these cases the singular would not soan.

175 (2) Plural for rhetorical effect; i. 78 sceptra (5 174 also
applies here); i. 206 regnu ,¹ i. 348-350 Sychaeum impius
acte ᾱνᾱε . . . superat. So especially bella, certamina, proc· ,
lia. The plural magnifiee and so emphasizes the importancf
of the single thing spoken of.

1⁷6 (3) Plural of abstract nouns; i. 11 trae, ‘angry passione ’ 3
i. 41 fririae, ‘mad deeds' 3 iv. 623 odia, ‘eonsuming hatred.'
These uses are closely akin to that in ξ 17 5, since the plural
emphasizes hy giving the idea of repetition. abundance, or
intensity. ’

In some cases the idea, though represented in Latin prose
as in English by a singular, is after all essentially plural.
Thus Vergil uses the plural: ⁴

1⁷7 (4) In local names and words designating places, to describe
