language clauses are arranged side by side either without
conjunctione or with coordinating conjunctions, no attempt
being made to indicate their logical relations. This arrange
ment is called parataxis (coordination). Latin prose in the
. main prefers hypotaxis or subordination, clause being subor- =
dinated to clause in such away as to bring out with the nicest
care their logical relations. The poete, partly as a matter 01
convenience, partly from love 01 the archaic, often use para
tactic forms In Vergil we recognize several forms, effected:

(1) By the use 01 parenthetical sentences ; i. 12 Urbs antiqua 219
1011- Tyrii tenuere colent (instead 01 quam Tyrii, etc.); i.
150 iamqrrefuces elsarn 001001- furor arma ministrat (instead
offerere orma ministrante, or cum arma furor ministret); i. 530.

(2) By the use 01 clauses arranged asyndetically, 1. e. with· 220
out conjunctions3 i. 159 cst . . . loeas: tracta portum efficit
(instead 01 locus ubi insula, etc.); ii. 172 Via positum castras
simulacrum: arsere . . . flammae (rnstead 01 cum . . .

amarae).

(3) ssy the use 01 clauses closely connected by et, pue, ac, 221
atque (01. ἐξ 199, 200), ii. 692 Va en fotus crat subitoque
. . . intonuit (for cum sabito, etc.); iii. 8 Vin primu inceperat
aestas et poter. . . iubebat (for cum paler . . . iubebat).

using slightly varying forms 01 expression. Such parallelism
is characteristic 01 Hebrew poetry, e. g. the Book 01 Proverbs
and the Psalrns. Cf. ‘Rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither
ahasten me in thy hot displeasure.⁷ In Vergil the use is
probably an outgrowth 01 his love 01 epic fullness 01 expres-
sion (see ἐξ 182, 183). For examples see i. 19-22, 21, 41,
