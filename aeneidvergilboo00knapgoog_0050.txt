poem was very popular with the Romans.

livius Andronicus3 Naevium Ennius—The first epic poet 72
01 Rome was Livius Andronicus (about 240),a Greek pris-
oner 01 war brought to Rome after the war with Pyrrhus.
After gaining his freedom he became teacher, actor, and
author'3 besides tragedies he wrote every rude translation of
the Odyssey. Gnaeus Naevius, a Campanian by birth, dealt
in his Bellona Panicum with the First Punic War. By way
01 preface there was an account 01 the early history 01 Rome,
the starting-point 01 which was Aeneas's ssight from Troy.
But the greatest epic poet of Rome prior to Vergil was Quin-

the wanderings 01 AeneaS, and so correspond 10 the Odyssey,
the story 01 the wanderings 01 Odysseus (ξ 10); the last six
books, like the Iliad, deal chiefly with war. In many places
Vergil is doing little more than translate Homer. To his
Roman predecessors in cpio poctry Vergil owed much. Nae-
vius and Ennius ‘had established the· mythical connection 01
Rome withTroy, and had originated the idea 01 making ,
Rome itself . . . the central interest, one might almost say,
