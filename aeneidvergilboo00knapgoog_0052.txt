e. The Aeneid cs aa Epic Pocm

General Remarks. —It is time now to consider the charae· 76
ter of the Aeneid as an epic poem. It conforme closely to the
definition given above (ὅ 69); i is impressive by its very
length, its story is lofty, and its langnage and ‚verse reaoh
imposing heights of dignity and grandeur. Tennyson called
Vergil the “

Wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips oi man. Ι

The unity of the story is, in general, faithfully preserved.
The 'l'wo Types of Epio Poetry.-There are two distinotw

types of epic poetry, the one primitive and original, the other
late in origin, artificial and imitative, the result of an attempt
to apply the primitive epieto changed conditions. Το the
former type belong the Homeric poema, to the latter the
Aeneid. In the primitive epic the story is told for its own
sahe3 there is no trace of any moral, of any one idea as the
thought of the poem, no hint of any special purpose ior the
advancement of which the story is told. In the imitativa
epic, on the contrary, the story is merely amsans to an end3
so in the Aeneid the story of Aeneas is a means of glorifying
Rome (ἓὲ 59-63) and Augustus (§§ 64, 65). Again, the
primitive epic belongs to an early and simple age of the
world3 the imitativa epic is the produot of an advanced civil-
ization‚ the work of a learned poet. Lastly, the two types
differ widely in langnage and style. In the primitive epic
these are simple and straightforward3 the imitativa epic is
apt to be learnedly elaborate, prone to suggest ideas by allu-
sions more or less definite instead oi saying plain things in a
plain way. Its langnage is often artificially subtle. Even
a superficial acquaintance with Paradisc Lost will suffice to
illustrate these points.
