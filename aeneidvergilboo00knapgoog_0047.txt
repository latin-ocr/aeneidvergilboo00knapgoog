destiny of Aeneas and his descendants, in other words, ot
Rome. The Julian rece, be it remcmbered, claimed direct
deseent from Ioles,1 the son of Aeneas. In the account of
Aeneas's shield (ξ 60) everything leads up to the story of the
victory at Actium and the triumph subsequently celebrated
by Augustus. Anchises prophesies (ἓ 59) that Augustus will
restore the Golden Age of the world, and by his conquesta
will compass a wider expense of earth ¹than was covered even
by the wanderings of Hercules. After death Augustus, like
Romulus of old, is to dwell in heaven as a god.

65 Since Vergil’s object was to praise the whole glorious career
of Rome (ὅ 61) it was inevitable that he should dwell with
especial emphasis on the age of Augustus, an age which to¹
many must have seemed the brightest epoch in that career.
In the twelve years between the battle of Actium and the
death of Vergil Italy and the provinces had abundantly ex-
perienced the benefits of the rule of Augustus(§§16,17).
When we remcmber that for a hundred years civil war, with
its attendant horrors of bloodshed and proscriptione, had
been almost incessant, we can readily forgive Vergil and his
contemporaries for characterizing as more than human the
man through whose masterful rule war had been replaced by
peace, and chaos by law and order. In their inmost hearts,
no doubt, there was no small measure of true feeling back of
the language of adulation in which they so often address

Augustus.

Emperor's attempt to revive religious enthusiasm (§§ 20, 21);
hence, the religious clement of the Aeneid is all-pervasive.
