Odyssey Odysseus— in a word a man—is the central thought 3
in the Aeneid, on the contrary, it is not in Aeneas as a man,
but in the Rome that he represents that interest is concen-
trated. This altered point of view Vergil owes to Naevius
and Ennius. ,

74 Vergil as an Imitator.—Whenever we think of Vergil's
indebtedness to preceding writers we should keep certain con-
siderations firmly in mind. First, in¹ Vergil's time the close
study of all existing models, especially Greek models, was the
fundamental law of poetioal composition. Secondly, many of
the resemblances between the verses of Vergil and those of
this or that Greek or Roman predecessor were probably acci-
dental or due to unconscious reminiscence. We may compare
the fact that more than once critice and reviewers pointed out
resemblances between what Tennyson had written and worko
which, as it happened, he had never read. Tennyson is said
to have complained that there were critice who seemed to
imagine that the same idea could 1101 000111 independently to

¹ statement that Vergil imitated the writings of others is not
of itselt a condemnation or a reproach. 1111 were, we should
have to condemn much that ie best in modern liberaturos. Nc
one, however, refuses to acknowledge the greatness or the ’
originality of Shakspere or Milton, even though he knows
that both poets borrowed freely from writers in more than
one language. Vergil horrowed much, it is true, but, like
Shakspere, he gave in many cases a new and more splendid
form to what he had horrowed. We may recall with profit,
else, the declarationes Lowell that those are entitled 101101-
row who are ableto lend. Ii this is so, then surely the poet
of the Aeneid, who has lent so much — eg. to Milton and to
Tennyson—was himself entitled to levy tribute upon others.
Finally, we might apply 10 Vergil the comment made by
. Dryden on Ben J onson’s tragedies: ‘He invaded authors lik'c
