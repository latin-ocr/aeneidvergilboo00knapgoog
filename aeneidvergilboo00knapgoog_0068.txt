The Tenues. - (1) The ordinary tense of narration in Latin 149
poetry is ‘the present of virid narration‚' a natural result of
the poet'e effort to impress as profoundly as possible the
imaginatione of his readers. For examples see i. 83-94. -

view the aot in process of aoeomplishment (it passos too
rapidly){ we ean only look back on it after it is past. Cf.

i. 84 iacobum i. 90 iatoauere; i. 130 latuere. Our transla-

the present of virid nar-ration and the instantaneous perfect
aro effectively combined3 see i. 83-94.

tion was to represent the subject as both door and sufferer,

pressed in Greek by one word, awerb in the middle voice. In
Latin prose we should say oceidit se. Latin poete, however,
often use passive forms as middles:
