Aeneas is under the guidanoe of the gods and of the fatos.
The opening verses of the poem tell us that Aeneas’s purpose
was to bring his country’s gods into Latium and to lay the
foundations of the Roman state. Aeneas ever seeks by
prayer and sacrifice to appease the gods and to learn their
will. From first to last the destinies of Rome are moulded
by the gods Nowhere does this religious element manifest 67
itself more strikingly than in the description of the shield of
Aeneas (ξ 60). Augustus is pictured there as leading to battle
not only all classes of Rome’s loyal subjects, but the gods as
well3 Apollo especially fights for'him (5 18). On Antony's
side fight ‘monstrous forms of gods of every birth) The
battle thus has a double meaning as a struggle not merely for
the preservation ol the Roman state but for the defcnce of
the Roman gods as well. At his triumph Augustus conse-
crates to the gods ‘a votive tribute of deathless gratitude,
three hundred fanes the city through? The allusion to the

Emperor⁷s activity in building and restoring temples (ξ 20> ,is
plain. In every temple, continues Vergil, one sees blaziug

incense, sacrifices of thanksgiving, and rich presents, offered
by all the nations of the earth to Apollo. The spirit of the
whole description is identical with that pervading the ode of
Horace referred to above (ξ 21).

,Important too, in this connection are the constant refer-68
ences to religious customS, sacred places and the like. Vergil
is fond of tracing Roman rites and ceremonies back to ancient
and impressive origins Thus, Aeneas’s visit to the Sibyl,
made in accordance with a warning from supernatural sources, ·
supplies an effective poetical explanation of the importance
ascribed in Roman history to the famous Sibylline books.
