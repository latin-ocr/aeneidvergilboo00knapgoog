ΤΗΕ MYTHOLOGY OF VERGIL 101

Propheeies and oraclee - Originally the knowledge of ³10
future events was possessed only by Iuppiter. He bestowed
it, however, upon other gods, and they in turn upon their
offspring or upon iavered mortale. All this is set forth by

the Harpy Celaen0, who declares (iii. 251) that she reveals the
secrete which Iuppiter had unfolded to Apollo· and Apollo

in turn had communicated to her. The terme for prophet are
ocyor (iv. 376, irc 327) and, more frequently, cates (e. g. ii. 122).

The seers¹ mentioned are Calchas, prophet of the Greeks
before Troy (ii. 122 ia), Cassandra, prophetess oi the Tro

jans, inspired by Apelle, but by him condemned to have

her utterances disregarded by her countrymen (ii 246 ff, iii. ⁷
182 ff), Nautes, inspired by* Minerva (v. 704 ff), and the
nymph Carmentis (viii. 336 ff. ;' §.292).

The seers possessed their gift of prophecy only in limited ³11

measure, many things being concealed from them. So Helenus

says to Aeneas (iii. 377), pauco tabi ἒ multas . . . capedinem
datas, prohibeat raam cetera Pareae seire Helenam farique octat
Saturnio Iano. The gift of prephecy was possessed also by

all mortale to whom immortality was vouchsafed or who ,
became divine beings after their removal from earth, and by

the spirits of the dead, the Martae. So Aeneas’s wife Creusa,
who does not die but becomes an immortal attendentes the
magna deam yeoetraoeybelas 275), gives Aeneas, immedi-
ately aiter her translation from earth, abrief outline of his

⁴ destiny (ii. 780 ft). From the spirit of his father Anchises,
Aeneas learns in detail the glorious history of his descendants
(vi. 756-886).

&acles-As seats of eracles mention is medeci Delphi, 312
described simply as oraculo Paoecr (ii. 114), oi Delos (iii. 7 9
ff, especially 88, 89), and Cumae (vi. 9 fi). On arriving at
Delos Aeneas goes at once to the temple of Apollo, and
questions the god about the further course of his voyage,
Cumae is the seat of the Sibyl, the priestess of Apollo. The
utteranees ol the oracles were proverbially dark and myste-
