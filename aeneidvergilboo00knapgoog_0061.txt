3. Miscellaoeous Forms

106 Here again (cf. ξ 101) metrical considerations were at work.

We note:
(1) Forms like vinclum i. 54, oraclum iii. 143, periclum

ii. 709, instead of the familiar uinculum, ornantium, periculum.
Vergil is using the older forms 3 the u in vinculum, etc, is a
late insertion for phonetic reasons. ¹

107 (2) Syncopatcd, ic. abbreviated, forms, due to the loss of
a short vowel after an accented syllable ; repostum (= reposi-
tum) i. 263 compostus (=,compositus) i. 2493 supposta vi. 243
aspris (ε asperis) ii. 37 9.

108 (3) Contracted forms like taonis (= taeniis) v. 269.

. 109 (4) ast, an archaic form of at, occurs several times, i. 46,

116, ii. 467, etc, always, except in one place, before a vowel.
In these cases ost is metricaliy convenient, since it gives the
required hcavy (ξ 228) syllable.

110 (5) suscipio appears occasionaHy as concipio, succepit i.
17 5. These are the older· and more correct forms, sud is usu-
ally assimilated before c, as in succedo, succendo, succenseo, etc.

II. Svurnx
1. Tire Noun

(1) Tun Gurrrurvn

111 Genitive of Definition— This genitive, instead of some form
of appositional expression, is more freely used than in prose.
It is found:

’(1) In general expressions3 i. 27 spretae iniuria formae,
‘the wrong done in the slighting of her beauty' ; i. 399 pubes
tuorum (= the prosc petes tuo), ‘the warrior company formed
by your peoplc' ; vi. 408 venerabile donum fetialis viryae,
‘ the ave-inspiring gift formed by (consisting of) the fateful
branch.'

112 (2) With geographical names; i. 247 arbem Parnon vii.
