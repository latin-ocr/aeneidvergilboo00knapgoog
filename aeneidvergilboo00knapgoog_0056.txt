THE GRAMMAR AND STYLE OF VERGIL 45

Recent criticism. —It has been said (ἓ 79) that there have 84
been few discordant notes in the chorus of praise which has
welcomed the Aeneid. As a matter of fact the poem, on its
publication, was severely assailed by certain critice, but these
attacks were speedily silenced. Thereafter, down to the
beginning oi the present century, the world's admiration for
Vergil went practically unchallenged. Since that time, how-
ever, numerous critice, especially in Germany, have sharply
attaoked the Aeneid. The main charge brought against it·
is lack oi originality. The answer to this is contained in
ἐξ 74, 75. ’

It remains to notice very briefly one reason for this modernos
depreciation of Vergil. The writers and scholare oi the
Middle Ages and those of the first centurias of ¹the revival oi

’ learning knew no Greek. The spread of Greek learning,
opening up as it dru' such marvels of oreative power as the
Iliad and the Odyssey, was certain ultimately to work un-
favorably to a poem so largely imitativa as the Aeneid. It
was natural that the palm should be given to the older and
more original work. But even German criticism is coming
once more to do Vergil justice, by recognizing the fact that
the Homeric poems and the Aeneid cannot be direotly com·
pared, since they are types oi different forms of art (ἓ 77),
and that therefore the attempt to compare them is unscien-
tifie and sure to lead to wrong results, and finally that the
Aeneid is as easily supreme in its sphere as are the Homeric ·
poems iu theirs.
