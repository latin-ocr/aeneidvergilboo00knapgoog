ΤΟ VIRGIL

(A poem ertten by Tennysom at the request ol the people of Mantua, on the
N lneteenth Centenary of Vergil's death.)

Roman Virgil‚ thou that singest llion’s lofty temples robed in fire,
Ilion falling, Romo arising, ware, and filial saith, and Dido's pyre;

Landseape-lovor, lord of language more than he that sang the Works
All ιὴθῗὲοξῗῖἓὲίη of fancy flashing out from many a golden phrase ς

Thou that singest wheat and woodland, tilth and vineyard, hive and
horse and herd,
All the oharm of allthe Muses often flowering in a lonely word;

Poet of the happy Tityrus piping underneath his beeohen bowers3
Poet of the poet-satyr whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers3

Chanter of the Pollio, glorying in the blisslul years again to be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow, unlaborious earth and oarless sea3

Thou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind;
Thou majestis in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind 3

Light among the vanish’d ages; star that gildest yet this phantom shore ς
Golden branch amid the shadows, kings and realms that pass to riso no
more ;

Now thy Forum roars no longer, fallen every purple Caesar's dome-
Tho' thino oeean-roll of rhythm sound lor ever of Imperial Rome -

Now the Rome of slaves hath perish'd, and the Rome of freemen holds
her place,
1, from out the Northern Island sunder’d once from all the human raoe,

1 salute thee, Mantovano‚ Ithat loved thee since my day began,

Wielrler of the stateliest measure everemoulded by the lips of man
