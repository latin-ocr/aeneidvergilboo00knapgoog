98 INTRODUCTION

³03 This mysterious power is characterized by various names.
A common term is Fato (i. 32, 205, iii. 375, 616). Others
6161011100 (11. 49),1011000 omnipotens ct 1οἑ1061111161ᾱ1001
(viii. 334), Parcae (i. 22, iii. 379). In the 6616601 ‘it is

fated' we find such expressions as fos cst (11. 779), postquam
0161101 stuporis (iii. 1, 2), and dis 011161οῖ1001 (ii. 428).

604 11 seeking to determine Vergil⁷s conception 01 111616166,
we note at onc'e that no definite inferences 661 be drawn 11011
the terms in which the human actors in the Aeneid spealr 01
them. On the other hand these mortals constantly pray to
the gods as the givers 01 611 good things, with the thought,
apparently, that their own destinies rested entirely in the
hands 01 the deities whomthey address. From the terms,
however, in which the gods themselves spealr 01 1616, 11 16
61661 that all the (1611166, even Iuppiter, 616 6111)]’601 10 this
mysterious power. We get 6 111110111116 at the very outset.
11110 designs to make Carthage 6 world power, 11001 Fata
siccat (1. 18), ‘ 11 11 any wise the Fates permit' luppiter is
the personal representative 01 111616166, charged with exeout
ing their will. 1116 this fact which makes it possible 101 1116Ι
poet 10 0611 Iuppiter omnipotens (1. 69), and 10 speak 01 him
as ‘swaying the affairs 01 gods and men with neverending
might' (1. 229). The inconsistency is apparent rather than
real3 since Iuppiter was the viceroy 01 the 16166, the execu-
tive power by which their will was carried out, it was easy
and 1611161 101 the poet to spealr 01 him as all-powerful, and
to represent him at times 66 a power 6011111616 with the
16166 01 even superior 1ο them.

305 We may note finally that though the gods could not set
at nought the will 01 the 16166 they might delay, even· for a
long time, its accomplishment. This appears very clearly ,
from the words 01 Iuno herself (vii. 313 ff.): ‘Granted that
I shall not be able to keep Aeneas from the throne of Latium

. . . Ι can at least retard events so momentons and add delays
thereto’ Of , 100, viii, 398, 399.
